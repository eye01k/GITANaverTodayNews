        A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of
        actions automatically.[2] A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded
        within. Robots may be constructed to evoke human form, but most robots are task-performing machines, designed
        with an emphasis on stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.
        <br><br>
        Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative
        Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots,
        patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General
        Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating
        movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous things are expected to
        proliferate in the future, with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers.[3]
        <br><br>
        The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots,[4] as
        well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. These
        technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or
        manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are
        inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer
        branch of robotics: soft robotics.
        <br><br>
        From the time of ancient civilization, there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and
        even automata resembling humans and other animals, designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical techniques
        developed through the Industrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines,
        remote-control and wireless remote-control.
        <br><br>
        The term comes from a Slavic root, robot-, with meanings associated with labor. The word 'robot' was first used
        to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 Czech-language play R.U.R. (Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti – Rossum's
        Universal Robots) by Karel Čapek, though it was Karel's brother Josef Čapek who was the word's true
        inventor.[5][6][7] Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first
        electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol, England in 1948, as well as Computer
        Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in the late 1940s by John T. Parsons and Frank L. Stulen.
        <br><br>
        The first modern digital and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and spawned his seminal
        robotics company, Unimation. The first Unimate was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it lifted pieces of hot
        metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township,
        New Jersey.[8]
        <br><br>
        Robots have replaced humans[9] in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or
        are unable to do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or
        the bottom of the sea. There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots
        are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions.[10]
        The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential
        repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.
